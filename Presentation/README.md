## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key findings from analysis:
- Mumbai (25.3%) and Bangalore (22.3%) dominate restaurant density and total orders  
- Order peaks observed in March (~110K) and October (~104K), indicating seasonal demand  
- Weak correlation between ratings and delivery time  
- Top restaurant (ID 302) leads sales driven by a medium price range strategy  
- Revenue concentration highest in Bangalore (Area A), lowest in Kolkata (Area E)  

### KPI Snapshot:
- Total Sales: ₹1.04M  
- Average Rating: 3.76

## Key Business Insights
- Metro cities (Mumbai & Bangalore) drive the highest order demand and revenue  
- Pricing impacts order volume more than delivery time  
- Top restaurants contribute disproportionately to total sales  
- Mismatch between restaurant availability and order density reveals untapped demand  

---

## Business Recommendations
- Focus on metro cities for expansion and marketing efforts  
- Increase restaurant availability in high-demand, low-supply areas  
- Promote medium price range menus  
- Partner closely with top-performing restaurants  
- Improve delivery efficiency to increase customer loyalty
